# CH55x Web Programmer
- This web page uses the JS library by [Dequing Sun](https://github.com/DeqingSun/ch55xduino/tree/ch55xduino/bootloaderWebtool) to program the CH55x series of microcontrollers via WebUSB.
- I've added a clean UI to the great work done by Dequing Sun. The programmer is hosted at [https://stephenkingston.github.io/CH55x-WebProgrammer/ ](http://www.stephenkingston.net/CH55x-WebProgrammer/)
- This has been tested to work on CH551G and the CH552G. On Windows, replace the default driver with WinUSB using [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/).
